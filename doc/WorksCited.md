Brejon, Chris. "Chapter 1: Color Management." CG Cinematography, 10 Mar. 2020, https://chrisbrejon.com/cg-cinematography/chapter-1-color-management/.

> My initial resource that spring boarded me into this research. It is a large collection of color management topics, with an attempt to create a simple holistic explanation for each piece. It doesn't do the best at painting the larger image clearly, but it is a great resource for a first timer or for someone who is looking for a quick review on a given color management topic.

Colour Science. "The Importance of Terminology and sRGB Uncertainty." Colour Science, 5 Dec. 2015, https://www.colour-science.org/posts/the-importance-of-terminology-and-srgb-uncertainty/.

> A quick article that clearly describes what attributes makes up a color space and why clarity in color space terminology is critical to meaningfully discussing color.
