# Color Management

![ColorManagement](./doc/img/CMWGeneral.svg)

This research is an attempt for me to better understand color management in an animation pipeline. This document will be ongoing, as my understanding and research grows. That being said, I do not claim that anything on this document is perfect, or even correct; it is simply my best understanding of said topics. 

I hope this will be a resource to others. Please reach out if you have any feedback or areas of correction.

> **_NOTE:_** This repo also serves as a storage location for useful [OCIO](./doc/Glossary.md/#opencolorio-ocio) configurations in an animation pipeline. See [OCIO Page](./doc/OCIO.md) for further clarification on [OCIO](./doc/Glossary.md/#opencolorio-ocio) configurations.
